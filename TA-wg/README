TA-wg
=====

TA-wg ingests and parses WireGuard debug log events. It requires a Linux operating system. The instructions (in Splunkbase) assume that systemd, systemd-journald and rsyslog are used on the monitored distribution.

WireGuard kernel log events written to `/var/log/wireguard` (or another destination file) and indexed. TA-wg parses those events on the search head and adds various metadata fields.

TA-wg was developed by [Frank Wayne](frank.wayne@northwestern.edu).
